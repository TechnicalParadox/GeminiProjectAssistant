# Backstory
Version 0 was originally generated by Google Gemini 1.5 Pro through the Google AI Studio. I made tweaks and had to do a lot of prompt engineering to help the AI understand. (Counting tokens was the hardest concept to grasp.)
After growing frustration with the subtle bugs related to token counting, specfically when deleting messages from history, and growing tired of prompt engineering, I decided to take the base and rebuild from the ground up.
